# Style Transfer via CycleGAN

In machine learning, the study of generativeadversarial networks (GANs) is currently one of the mostexciting topics. In brief, in GANs, the generator and thediscriminator compete in a game with each other with thegoal of generating new data that can pass for real data.In this project, we will explore two types of GANs - DeepConvolutional GAN (DCGAN) and CycleGAN, with moreemphasis on the latter. DCGAN is used to generate emojis,and CycleGAN is used to transform the style of one imageto another. The results show that the cycle consistency losshas improved the results of the CycleGAN model. In thecase of DCGAN, mode collapse was observed.
